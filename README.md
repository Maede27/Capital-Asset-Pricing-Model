This project inspired by Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), attempts to model stock returns based on
regression. In CAPM, we are determining how our stock is related to the overall market, using a regression
structure. We extend this model by adding commodity trading prices for oil, gold, gas and
currency exchange rate as explanatory variables.
