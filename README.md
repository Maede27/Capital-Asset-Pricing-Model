# Capital Asset Pricing Model
This project inspired by Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), attempts to model stock returns based on
regression. In CAPM, it is important to find out how the stock is related to the overall market, using a regression
structure. The model will beextended by adding commodity trading prices for oil, gold, gas and
currency exchange rate as explanatory variables.
